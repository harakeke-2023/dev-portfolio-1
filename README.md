## Usage

### The project was written with the intention to download it in full or in parts. You can copy all files or use any portions of this project.

### For example:

### If you only want to use the contact page, you select the files that are visible inside the contact.html file.

### Additionally, some files were saved separately to avoid code multiplication (button.css, reset.css, sec-first.css and sec-first.js.). For example, if you want to use only sections with buttons, you can do so!
